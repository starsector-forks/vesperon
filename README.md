# Vesperon Combine #

A flavour, event enhancement and quality-of-life mod for Starsector. 

The Vesperon Combine is a mysterious, well-informed organisation with no known base of operations, but its representatives can be found frequenting the bars and ports of civilized societies. 

Positioning itself as a foil to the more powerful organised concerns in the Persean Sector, membership is available to those who prove themselves a friend to lawful independent worlds. In return, Vesperon provides a range of unique services based on its ever-growing database of pre-Collapse intelligence.  

## Current Features ##

- **Blueprint hunts**: Vesperon agents can point members towards hidden technology vaults containing, amongst other things, long-lost UACs for ships, weapons and fighters. But beware: other parties are *very* interested in securing these valuable facilities first...

## Planned Features ##

- Unique ships, weapons and fighters
- Rival techminers 
- Station events
- Uber-level rewards
