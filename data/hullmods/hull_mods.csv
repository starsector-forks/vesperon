Automation Centre,vesperonAutomationCentre,,,,,,,,TRUE,,0,0,0,0,org.stratic.fs.starsector.hullmods.AutomationCentre,"This ship has been converted to run for short periods of time without human crew. The energy used to provide life support are instead diverted to shields and engines, resulting in %s less damage to shields and a %s boost to top speed.

However, without dedicated service and repair drones, the ship is prone to random malfunctions in combat. Peak operating time is also reduced by %s.",Converted to run without a dedicated crew.,graphics/hullmods/automated.png
Advanced Targeting Cluster,vesperonTargetingClusterMaster,,,,,,,,TRUE,,0,0,0,0,org.stratic.fs.starsector.hullmods.TargetingClusterMaster,"This system coordinates with slave nodes on other ships to form an distributed analysis engine that increases ballistic and energy weapon range for all ships in the cluster by a base of %s/%s/%s/%s, depending on hull size, plus a bonus of %s/%s/%s/%s for each ship in the cluster.

Can only apply range enhancement to other ships equipped with an Advanced Targeting Slave, and can only be installed on a capital ship.",Enhances weapons range for automated ships.,graphics/hullmods/targeting_supercomputer.png
