vesperon_facility,CUSTOM,"A colossal facility, apparently embedded into the rock face of an asteroid, and clearly designed to blend in with the surrounding field. Without Vesperon's intelligence dossier, locating this facility with active scanning technologies would prove all but impossible.",,,
vesperon,FACTION,"An apparent offshoot to a relatively obscure corporate security group operating out of the Spartan and Dionysean sectors. The Vesperon Combine - successor to the now defunct Vesperon Integrated Security corporation - operates a small number of individuals scattered across the Core, with no recorded ships or base of operations. They have, however, been linked - in a number of dubious circles, at least - to apparently independent tech-mining operations on the fringes.

Although the capabilities and ideological position of the Combine are not publicly known, its predecessor company held contracts in military-grade intelligence and security for a number of high-profile corporate bodies, including the Tri-Tachyon corporation. How many of these specialisms the Combine has inherited and developed is yet to be determined."
